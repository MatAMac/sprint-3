Website = A digital CV which I might use to promote myself as a web developer
Not very creative yeah I know but I was going to do it anyway so I figured this kind of fits right?
If this doesn't work then lets just assume then I am aiming at a website for job seekers not just myself. in this case a website with a number of profiles of people seeking work. I am not good at imagining, if this is way off course then I will just do it again.

Objectives:
1) promote abilities as a web developer
  i) show various coding skills - use the website as an example of what I have done and can do. use HTML, CSS, JavaScript from the course and maybe some skills like photoshop and Java which i have qualifications in from other places. Maybe state ability with other stuff not too sure yet.
  ii) show skills at design and layout - use all of the features and techniques that make a website good. that is to say use css, html and JS where they should be used, make site to web standards etc.
2) list my positive personal attributes - typical CV stuff really. ctrl + c, ctrl + v from my CV then reformat.
3) provide useful contact details - maybe use an embedded map here, use telephone and email links etc
4) add some additional stuff for showing off maybe add a small web game or something
5) use as practice for course :)





Had a look at Affinity diagrams (pictures are nice) and Paper prototyping (I like working with paper).

Affinity diagrams look to be a good way of taking ideas from a group and sorting and refining them. I like the idea that it gets everyone involved and takes a democratic approach. Also the categorization and sorting and stuff seems like a very logical and tidy way of dealing with the varying input from a number of different people with different ideas.

The concept of Paper Prototyping seems like it would be something you would naturally do. It seems like a brilliant method of producing a start point for an app's GUI or a layout of a website. working with paper is good too because you can sketch out something easily, quickly and for next to no cost; this beats everyone making a gui for example and showing each other then sying "oh I like this or that" and making iterations of GUI's till one is decided upon. Many different designs can be sketched out on paper before one prototype can be made on a machine.


Metrics

In this case it could be site traffic. one would be interested in how many people visit my site, how many people visit certain parts of my site and things of that nature. it could tell you, hey you aren't getting people to look at you qualifications or maybe they dont use the contact page. this could identify errors in design or a lack of content or keywords that would entice users to view on and ultimately contact the site owner for an interview.
this in itself could be used to show competency, a view count could be added to a site or something like that.
Also direct contact made due to the site's existence would be a measurable metric.
