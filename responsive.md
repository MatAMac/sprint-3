I have used responsive web design a little from the team treehouse courses and I quite like just being able to resize the window and watch the page move and fit. It is very satisfying to see a page move correctly and I even tried opening a web page on my smart phone and to my delight it had perfectly resized.
It is very obvious that time is saved by not having to write multiple pages for multiple devices. With the growing number of different screen sizes across different devices, RWD is essential and it means that with careful design and planning, one website can be viewed properly in a wide range of screen sizes.
Also the idea of being able to have less important elements disappear when space is low is an essential concept as ithelps to reduce clutter or the possibility of tiny text and similar issues.
I personally feel that responsive apps are far superior, if an app is not responsive then it may not have the ability to be accessed by everyone or else it will have to be made multiple times for different users with different devices.
